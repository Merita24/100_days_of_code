# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** journey! This repository documents my daily commitment to learning, coding, and growing as a Python developer. Each day, I’ll share what I learned, the code I wrote, and reflections from the process.

---

## 📅 Start Date

**July 3, 2025**

---

## 📌 Goal

To **consistently code every day for 100 days**, deepening my understanding of Python and software development by:
- Strengthening my core programming skills
- Exploring intermediate/advanced Python concepts
- Building projects and documenting my learning publicly

---

## 🛠️ Topics I’ll Cover

- Python Fundamentals  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- List Comprehensions & Lambda Functions  
- Iterators & Generators  
- Functional Programming  
- `itertools` & Built-in Modules  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- File I/O & Exception Handling  
- Projects & Mini Challenges  
- Web Scraping & Automation (TBD)

---

## 🧠 How I’m Learning

- Practicing with small exercises and projects
- Writing Medium blogs and LinkedIn posts  
- Sharing code and reflections daily in this repo  
- Using tools like LeetCode, Python docs, and YouTube tutorials

---

## 🔁 Rules

1. I will code for at least **1 hour every day** for 100 days.
2. I will push my code to GitHub **daily**.
3. I will **document what I learned** in a short summary or blog post.
4. I will **stay consistent**, even when life gets busy.
